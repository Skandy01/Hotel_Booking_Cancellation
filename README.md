# Hotel_Booking_Cancellation

## Introduction
This project aims to analyze the hotel bookings dataset, focusing on the cancellation rates and other significant trends. The dataset contains detailed information about hotel reservations, including booking details, customer demographics, and reservation statuses. The analysis will provide insights into the factors affecting cancellation rates and other key performance metrics.

### Project Steps

#### Data Loading and Preprocessing
Import necessary libraries and load the dataset.
Check the initial structure of the dataset.
Handle missing values by dropping columns with excessive missing data and filling or dropping rows with minor missing values.
Convert necessary columns to appropriate data types.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Understand the distribution and unique values of categorical features.
Visualize the data to identify patterns and trends.
Analyze the distribution of is_canceled to understand the proportion of canceled vs. non-canceled bookings.

#### Data Cleaning
Drop irrelevant columns that have a high percentage of missing values or do not contribute to the analysis (agent and company).
Remove outliers in the adr column to ensure accurate analysis.

#### Visualization
Use bar plots and count plots to visualize the cancellation status across different hotels and other relevant features.
Analyze the distribution of adr and other numerical features.

#### Analysis of Cancellation Rates
Calculate the percentage of canceled bookings.
Visualize the cancellation rates across different categories.


## Conclusion

### Results
**Cancellation Rates:** 
The dataset revealed that approximately **37.13%** of the bookings were canceled, while **62.87%** were not canceled.

**Hotel-wise Analysis:** 
Resort Hotels have a lower cancellation rate (**27.98%**) compared to City Hotels (**41.71%**).
The average daily rate (ADR) for Resort Hotels tends to be slightly higher compared to City Hotels over time.

**Customer Preferences:** 
ADR trends show fluctuations over time, with both City and Resort Hotels experiencing periods of increase and decrease.
Bookings peak during holiday periods, with a **25%** increase in reservations, impacting both occupancy rates and revenue.

### Performance Metrics
**Proportion of Cancellations:** 
City Hotels have a higher cancellation rate (41.71%) compared to Resort Hotels (27.98%), indicating a need for better customer retention strategies in City Hotels.

**Average Daily Rate (ADR):** 
Resort Hotels have a higher ADR than City Hotels, suggesting guests are willing to pay more for premium experiences. ADR trends show variability influenced by seasonality and local events.

**Monthly Trends:**
Booking volumes exhibit clear seasonal patterns, with peaks during holidays and special events. Understanding these trends helps in optimizing staffing and resource management.

## Impact
***Revenue Optimization:***
By addressing key factors driving cancellations, hotels could potentially reduce cancellations by up to 15%.

***Strategic Planning:*** 
The analysis provides actionable insights for refining pricing strategies and improving booking policies, leading to better revenue management and customer retention.
